	I have several project i want to look into, however the largest and most exctiting one is an interative website that requires a login for users that prevents unregistered users from accessing all content, and a specialized set of forms.  The forms are my biggest focus, each form needs to be dynamic, and based off of the type of imput, a numeric value is given that will interact with running total specific to the user.  This would be similar to how a shopping cart keeps track of how much money is spent.  </br>
	Each time a user logs in, they can access their total "points" and can "purchase" perks with those points from a list on the form.  The form would need to changed or update everytime a field is manipulated.  However, once all the points are used, the form needs to be inactive.   I also want to be able to add more points to a users total coffer, but prevent any fields from being modified once the points have been used to purchase something on the form.
